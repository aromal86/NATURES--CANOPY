            <h3>FOREST TYPE</h3>
            <p>Forests take up about 30% of the Earth’s land area and are home to over 80% of the World’s terrestrial species. 
            There are more than 60,000 tree species within these forests, and it is thought there are still many more to find. 
            Different factors like location, temperature, tree species and amount of rain all change how a forest is classified. 
            There are many different types of forest which are grouped into three main categories – Boreal, Temperate and Tropical.

            <h3 class="blue">FOREST RESERVE</h3>
            <p>A reserved forest (also called a reserve forest) and protected forest in India is a forest accorded a certain degree of protection. 
            The concept was introduced in the Indian Forest Act of 1927 during the British Raj to refer to forests granted protection under the British crown in British India, but not associated suzerainties.
            After Indian independence, the Government of India retained the status of the reserved and protected forests, and extended protection to other forests.

            <h3 class="blue">FOREST TIMBER</h3>
            <p>A forest is an ecosystem characterized by a dense community of trees.[2] Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function.
            The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ.

            <h3>FOREST SPECIES</h3>
            <p>Animals are an important part of our lives and the earth. 
            There are various types of animals that are put in a different category based on their characteristics, the places they live in, and more.
            You have pets who better live in cities and lead a domestic life. Then you have others who live in other areas. 
            One such kind is forest animals which are found mainly in different types of forests.They vary from one forest to another and adapt accordingly to the climate of that forest.
